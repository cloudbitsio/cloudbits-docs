```bash
$ thunder env create testing --branch=nightly

```

The above code would add the following to the ```thunder.yml``` dcoument in your project directory.

```yml
        -
            name: testing
            url: https://ambidextrous-susan-1234.thunderapp.com/
            branch: nightly
```
