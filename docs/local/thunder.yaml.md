Your project directory will contain a YAML definition with contents that look like:

```yaml 
project:
    name: bookshelf
    git: https://git.thunder.so/cherry-blossom-1234.git
    directory: site
    env:
        - 
            name: local
            url: https://bookshelf.local
        -
            name: staging
            url: https://cherry-blossom-1234.thunderapp.com
            branch: staging
            volumes:
                - web/app/uploads:bucket-cherry-blossom-1234
        -
            name: production
            url: https://cloudbits.io
            branch: main

```
