Thunder is an open source local development environment focused on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), powered by [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

Thunder is ideal for developing themes and plugins as well as for [contributing to WordPress core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/).

## Objectives

* Approachable development environment with a modern server configuration.
* Stable state of software and configuration in default provisioning.
* Excellent and clear documentation to aid in learning and scaffolding.

## Requirements
