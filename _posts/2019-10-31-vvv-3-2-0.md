Hi! Welcome to the very late release post for VVV [v3.2.0](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/releases/tag/3.2.0).

The biggest change is that we no longer use `vvv-custom.yml`, we've moved to `config/config.yml`. VVV will auto-migrate the file on the next command ran after update, and the format is still the same. We also changed site provisioning to log output to log files instead of the terminal. Terminal output should be much smaller and friendlier. We've also fixed a number of Hyper-V/Parallels/VMWare bugs.

[Check out the changelog for more details on what changed in VVV 3.2](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## VVV Slack

We now have a Slack Workspace! This is a great place to get help/support, ask quick questions, or watch VVV being developed. [Find out more about the VVV Slack](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/slack/).
