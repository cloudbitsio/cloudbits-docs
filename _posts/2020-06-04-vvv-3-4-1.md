We've been hard at work and have released ([v3.4.1](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/releases/tag/3.4.1). The `develop` branch has now moved to `3.5.0` in preparation for a `3.5.1` release in several months time

Before we continue, here's a recap of what changed in `3.3`:

- Installs the ntp date packages and starts the ntp service to fix time drift on sleep
- Fixes an issue with the ntpsec package by removing it
- Fixed the use of dots in site names breaking provisioning
- Improvements to the ruby code in the vagrant file
