Hi! Welcome to the very late release post for VVV <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/releases/tag/3.1.0"> v3.1.0</a>.

This is primarily a reliability update. Note that updating to v3.1 requires a `vagrant destroy` and a `vagrant up --provision`. Back up your database before updating.

### Enhancements

 - The vagrant box can now be overriden using the `box` parameter in `vvv-custom.yml` under the `vm_config` section. This requires a `vagrant destroy` followed by a `vagrant up --provision` to recreate the VM using the new box
 - The main provisioner now only fetches the apt keys once rather than on every key check
 - The TTY fix shell provisioner and the `/vagrant` setup shell provisioner were merged for a minor reduction in provisioning time.
 - Allow `db_backup` script to be run manually regardless if automatic DB backups are disabled
 - `vvv`, `vvv.dev`, and `vvv.local` now redirect to `vvv.test`
 - Added a premade Sequel Pro config file under the `database` folder
 - Set GitHub token from `vvv-custom.yml` for Composer

### Bug Fixes

 - Changed to the `ubuntu/bionic64` box to avoid issues with kernel page cache corruption until they can be identified, these were causing issues when updating a WP installation
 - Fixes to mysql user and group creation to improve shared folder reliability
 - Fixed an issue with permissions in files copied to the home folder
 - Fixed shared folder and permissions for Microsoft Hyper-V
 - Fixed all mount_options to the correct permissions for Microsoft Hyper-V
 - Set VM Name to exactly the same as VirtualBox, using v.vmname for Hyper-V
 - Fixes to log file paths for XDebug and PHP
 - Fixes files and folders in the home folder being owned by root instead of vagrant
 - Fixes support for database names containing hyphens in the import/restore scripts
 - Fixes the site provisioner attempting to clone site templates into existing sites when a site template is added to a site that didn't have one before, but has already provisioned ( it will note that this happened but won't clone the template )
 - Removed some references to Go
 - Fixed symlink issues with apt source files by copying instead
 - Specify `keep_colors` on vagrant provisioners to prevent composer from outputting valid messages in the red error colours, unnecessarily alarming users
 - `xdebug_on` and `xdebug_off` now toggle Tideways so that XDebug and Tideways are never running at the same time
 - Switched to Node v10 by default to fix compatibility issues with the WP Core build scripts
 - Runs the npm commands in the main provisioner under the vagrant user
 - Node v11 is now auto-downgraded to Node v10
 - Fixed Database SSH access from the host by enabling password authentication in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
 - Added code to remove NVM
 - Change Permission folder `/vagrant` from root to vagrant
